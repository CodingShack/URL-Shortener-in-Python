Hello Readers! So, you would have seen short URLs being used in various places (social media, websites, messaging platforms, etc.). Short URLs are easy to remember or type so they are very popular. 

No one loves long URLs and so the need to shorten lengthy URLs often comes to us.

We can write a program in Python language for our needs. Then we can give a long URL as the input and get short URLs as output, too in very few lines of code. Is not it exciting? The use of various APIs does it very easily without having to dig into complex topics.

We're going to use a library named [PyShorteners](https://pypi.org/project/pyshorteners/), which i think is the best library to shorten your URLs in Python. Let's begin the journey.

## What is a URL Shortener?
A URL shortener is a simple tool that takes a long URL and turns it into a short url which can be easily, remembered by an individual.

## What is PyShorteners?
PyShorteners is a Python library to help you short urls, it is the most . You just have to install the lib and you're good to proceed.

You can install the lib using the command given below.

```python
pip install pyshortners
```

After installing the PyShortener library let's start the Implementation part.

## Implementation

Here we have to import the PyShorteners Library before using it, if you have used python before you should can relate to it, but those who don't know about what we are talking about let's know that first.

In the first line of our code we have to import the library which we installed before, in order to use it's features.

Import the PyShorteners library using the code given below.
